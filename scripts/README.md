# scripts 
- main scripts go here (like data_preprocessing, algorithm classes and other final implementations)
- There should be a "main" script that calls any algorithmic class 
- Common functions may be implemented inside main 
- Data-preprocessing may be implemented inside main 
- Informal tests should **not** be included in main

## main.py
- Data pre-processing, calls to Bernoulli_NB and all the rest goes here. If the script becomes too big, or if we decide to implement some other extra class, we might create it in a different step. 

## Bernoulli_NB.py 
- Implementation of the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model as a class.
