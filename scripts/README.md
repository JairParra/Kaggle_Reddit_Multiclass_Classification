# scripts 
- main scripts go here (like data_preprocessing, algorithm classes and other final implementations)
- There should be a "main" script that calls any algorithmic class 
- Common functions may be implemented inside main 
- Data-preprocessing may be implemented inside main 
- Informal tests should **not** be included in main
