# Mini-Project 2: Kaggle Reddit multi-class classification
- Project for implementing multi-output classification of reddit data. 

## IMPORTANT/ANNOUNCEMENTS:  
- Group registration done on myCourses 
- **Don't forget** to start registration on Kaggle 
- nltk/spacy basic usage &  preprocessing tutorial ready at "notebooks" 
- Ideally, we would like to have data pre-processing, Naive bayes implementation, 
as well as a fitted Pipeline with results by **next wednesday** We will then use the rest of the time 
to polish up and write-up the project. 
- Short meeting after class on **Monday** to discuss progress.


## TASKS: 
-The following are the task divisions. These will be updated accordingly. 

### Jair: 
- Finish uploadin the nltk/spacy tutorials and setting up. **done**
- Naive Bayes implementation (compatible with sklearn). **Started, in progress**

## Ashray: 
- Get to know how to use nltk, spacy, re 
- Figure out how to apply the preprocessing steps
- If there are any other cleaning steps, feel free to apply them and document them (what does it do, why this cleaning step) 
- Implement a function with parameters for the cleaning 
- **Start working on implementing classification pipelines**

## Hamza:
